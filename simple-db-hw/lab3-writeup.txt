Lab 3: B+ Tree

Design Decisions and Challenges:
	Moving the tuples from page to page required a lot of iteration and while loops, but overall the most difficult thing for me was 
	understanding how to use the provided functions and making sure they were in the correct order. I also didn't realize at first that
	when going through a left page, I had to use the reverse iterator to scan the entries.
	
	The other aspect of the lab that wasn't initially intuitive for me was that I had to compare the fields to determine which page needed
	to be returned. Of course, now I understand that if the field is greater than the passed in value, then the right page should be returned,
	if it's not greater than the passed in value, then the parent/original page should be returned.
	
I did not change anything outside of BTreeFile.

This lab took me about six hours total. Mostly because I was confused which methods I needed to call in my own code.
